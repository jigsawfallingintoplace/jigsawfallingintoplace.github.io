[{"title":"tuningfork - Fun with data from Pitchfork - Pt. 0 - Preface","url":"/2019/10/06/tuningfork-pt-0/","content":"### Preface\n\nFor those of you who know me personally, you probably know that I'm a huge music nerd. Now, no matter if you're a music fanatic or not, \"discovering new music\" is something that you must have come across. For some, discovering new music is like a ritual in which you spend the entire Sunday afternoon: You drive to the local record store, talk with the owner who became a friend of yours because you come here so often, and he just *knows* your taste in music. He walks you to a shelf full of records, browses through the vinyl collection while mumbling \"where is it...\", and finally hands you a record that you have never seen before but you know you're gonna fell in love with it just by looking at the album cover. For some, discovering new music is not a task at all: you heard \"Senorita\" playing in a boba shop so you started to listen to it, and then thought Shawn Mendes was a good singer just because he looks handsome, and you play a total of 7 Shawn Mendes songs on repeat, before going to listen to Charlie Puth thanks to the \"Related Artists\" feature in the music app on your phone. \n\nAs a Generation-Z born and raised in Beijing who doesn't have a vinyl player, I never got the privilege to experience the former version, and I don't think I'm the type that fits in the latter stereotype as well. Of all the myriad of music discovery methods available via the internet, the one I use the most is a music journalism website named **[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/)**. Why? Because:\n\n- Their taste is more leaned on alternative music in general.\n- The \"Best New Music\" feature keeps me updated on the best current releases.\n- They upload lists once in a while so it's always fun to get a bunch of recommendations at once.\n- Their website interface (used to be) clean (and still is relatively cleaner than the other sites albeit the ads on the site currently).\n- ......and last but not least, **I don't know a single publication that writes better album reviews and features (from a literary perspective) than Pitchfork**.\n\nTo make my point clear, [here's a review they wrote](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/avril-lavigne-let-go/) on, not an indie band, not an experimental artist, but none other than Avril Lavigne's debut album *Let Go*. If we could just ignore the lukewarm score they gave, the entire review is full of passion but still objective, in some miraculous way. I myself used to listen to Avril when I was still in elementary school, so I never formed my thoughts the way they did in the review. Reading this review is... interestingly unbelievable. They used the word \"pugnacious\" to describe a song edgy-ly named \"Sk8er Boi\". That itself is enough to make my point.  \n\nAfter witnessing pitchfork publish some [questionable reviews](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-red/), Pitchfork only appears more curious to me. I wanted to extract all the interesting data from the site and analyze and play around the data that I've mined. What makes Pitchfork the tastemaker in Indie music? What are some words that they like to use? Can we write a program to let it write some random sentence Pitchfork-style? \n\nLet's see if we can answer all these questions and many more in this journey of ours.\n\n### Upcoming posts:\n- Mining data from every 8.0+ Pitchfork reviews (Python web scraping tutorial)\n- Determining what are some of Pitchfork's favorite words (with tutorial)\n- Using Markov Chain & n-grams to generate Pitchfork-esque sentences & paragraphs. (with explanation)\n- ...And more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","tags":["FEATURED","English","tuningfork","misc"]}]
